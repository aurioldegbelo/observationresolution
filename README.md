# Observation-based Theory of Spatial and Temporal Resolution

This repository contains an observation-based theory of spatial and temporal resolution (as Haskell specification), and two ontology design patterns (ODPs) for resolution: one ODP for the resolution of single observations, and one ODP for the resolution of observation collections.

The repository also contains a JavaCode which provides some examples of use of both ODPs.
